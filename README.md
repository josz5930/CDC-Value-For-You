## 🎯 Overview

Singapore's CDC vouchers come with specific constraints:
- **No change given**: Vouchers must be used in full
- **Denomination limitations**: Different voucher values have different denomination splits
- **Usage restrictions**: Some vouchers are restricted to specific merchant types
- **Expiry dates**: Vouchers must be used within a validity period

This calculator helps you understand the **real value** of your vouchers by accounting for:
- 💰 **Denomination loss**: Money "lost" when you can't spend the exact amount
- 🛒 **Spending patterns**: Your actual shopping habits at different merchant types
- 💭 **Willingness to pay**: Your subjective valuation of the vouchers

## 🧮 How It Works

### Method 1: Willingness to Pay (WTP)
```
WTP Value = Voucher Amount × (WTP Percentage / 100)
```
*Example: If you'd pay $210 for $300 vouchers (70% WTP), your subjective value is $210.*

### Method 2: Denomination Loss Estimator
```javascript
// Calculate loss for each transaction
function getLoss(spendAmount, denomination) {
    const remainder = spendAmount % denomination;
    if (remainder === 0) return 0;
    return denomination - remainder; // "Change" you don't get back
}

// Total loss across all visits
Total Loss = Σ(Loss per visit × Number of visits)
Denomination Value = Usable Amount - Total Loss
```

### Method 3: Incremental Spending (Opportunity Cost)
```
Total Eligible Spend = (Supermarket Spend × Visits) + (Heartland Spend × Visits)
Incremental Value = min(Voucher Amount, Total Eligible Spend)
```

### Final Output
The calculator presents a **value range** showing:
- **Minimum value**: Lowest of the three methods
- **Maximum value**: Highest of the three methods
- **Efficiency score**: (Calculated Value / Face Value) × 100%

## 🔒 Security

We have attempted some security in this application, although since it runs in your own computer and you should be the only user....

### Client-Side Architecture
- ✅ **No Server**: All processing happens in your browser
- ✅ **No Data Transmission**: Your financial data never leaves your device
- ✅ **No External APIs**: No calls to external computation services

### Input Protection
- ✅ **Strict Type Checking**: All inputs parsed as numbers with NaN rejection
- ✅ **HTML Encoding**: User data is entity-encoded before display
- ✅ **No Eval**: Zero use of `eval()`, `new Function()`, or `setTimeout(string)`

### DOM Security
- ✅ **textContent Only**: Results injected via `textContent`, never `innerHTML`
- ✅ **CSP Headers**: Content Security Policy restricts script sources
- ✅ **URL Sanitization**: URL parameters validated and type-coerced

### Privacy
- ✅ **No Cookies**: No session tracking
- ✅ **No Analytics**: No Google Analytics or similar
- ✅ **Optional LocalStorage**: Only stores data if explicitly requested
- ✅ **No Fingerprinting**: No browser fingerprinting techniques
